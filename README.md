# OpenCV-JS Projects

This repository is dedicated to various projects using **OpenCV.js**, a JavaScript binding for the popular OpenCV library. OpenCV.js allows developers to harness the power of OpenCVâ€™s computer vision capabilities directly in the browser or Node.js environment, making it ideal for image processing and real-time applications.

## About OpenCV.js
**OpenCV.js** brings OpenCV's extensive range of image manipulation and computer vision algorithms to the web. It provides functionality for tasks like object detection, image transformation, filtering, and more. With OpenCV.js, you can leverage these powerful tools using JavaScript, making it easier to integrate with modern web technologies.

## Projects in this Repository
I will be developing and showcasing several image processing projects using OpenCV.js. Some of the planned projects include:

- **[Upload Image](https://github.com/sj-silva/OpenCV-JS/tree/main/Upload%20Image)**: A project that allows users to upload images and perform various transformations.
- **Grayscale Images**: Convert images to grayscale using OpenCV.js functions.
- **Image Histogram**: Generate and visualize the histogram of an image, showing pixel intensity distribution.
- **Edge Detection**: Implement algorithms like Canny edge detection to find edges in an image.
- **Image Thresholding**: Apply thresholding techniques to segment images.
  
More projects will be added as development progresses. Feel free to explore and contribute!

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sj-silva/OpenCV-JS.git
   ```
2. Install OpenCV.js in your project or use the CDN for browser-based applications.

3. Open the HTML files in a browser to see the image processing in action.

## Future Plans
- Enhancing the user interface for better interaction.
- Adding more advanced image processing techniques like object detection and image filters.
